SOLID Principles:
    S - Single Responsibility Principle
        A class should have only one reason to change.
    O - Open / Closed Principle
        A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    L  - Liskov Substitution Principle
        A subclass should extend the capability of a parent class not narrow it down.
        Exp: If class B is subtype of class A, Then we should be able to replace object of A with object of B,
             Without breaking the behaviour of the program.
    I   - Interface Segmented Principle
        An interface such that, Client should not implement unnecessary functions that they do not need.
    D - Dependency Inversion Principle
        A class should dependent on interface rather than concrete class.


Advantages of SOLID Principles:
    -> Avoid duplicate code.
    -> Easy to maintain.
    -> Easy to understand.
    -> Flexible Software.
    -> Reduce complexity.
